				<h5>Currently, it appears quite possible that the two most dreaded diseases - cardiovascular disease and cancer - can be treated or prevented with the use of catechins, a group of polyphenol compounds found in tea leaves. This protective agent is found in the Australian gardens that grow tea. Some of the varieties of tea that contain catechins are White Tea, Green Tea, Oolong Tea (semi-fermented), and Black Tea (completely fermented). Black Tea and Oolong Tea are considered to be less effective for treatment because of their degrees of oxidation. <br>

				Amongst other things, tea polyphenols help prevent deposits that narrow the arteries. Prostate cancer in men can be slowed down with a daily dose of Green Tea. Acute hepatic failure, caused by inflammation or oxidative stress, can also be healed with Green Tea.</h5></p>

					<h5>The original idea for The Statue of Liberty was proposed by Edouard de Laboulaye, President of the French Anti-Slavery Society. A staunch political thinker and an abolitionist, Edouard Laboulaye, who supported the Union in the American Civil War, supposedly suggested the idea to the famous sculptor Frederic Bartholdi. He is supposed to have said that a memorial must be created as a toast to American independence and it must be built up with a common effort from both the countries. Another report suggests that Laboulaye believed that if this gift to the United States were built up on behalf of France, the French would feel encouraged to get over monarchy and call for democracy. In 1870, Bartholdi created the first model and then, even after returning to France, continued to improvise on the design.</h5></p>
				<h5>Which of the following most accurately summarizes the opinion of the author in the text?</h5>
					<form>
				<input type="radio" name="answer" value="0">A. Unlike proposed earlier, The Statue of Liberty wasn't erected by the joint effort of both the countries, rather it was a French gift to the Americans.<br>
				<input type="radio" name="answer" value="1">B. Laboulaye was never of the opinion that the memorial should be erected by utilizing the resources of France only.<br>
				<input type="radio" name="answer" value="2">C. The Statue of Liberty was fully built in the year 1870 by Bartholdi<br>

				<h5>Kleptomania is a behavioural and to some extent mental disorder in which the person has an excessive desire to steal something even if the thing is not at all needed by him/her. It doesnâ€™t end here, rather while doing it the person feels relieved and stress-free but later feels a strong sense of fear of getting caught and remorse to have performed the action. Such is the vicious cycle of this socially embarrassing disorder. Episodes of kleptomania happen without any planning and there is no personal gain involved. The articles stolen may later be placed back, or given to someone else. So, itâ€™s not out of need or greed that a person performs kleptomania. Itâ€™s a disorder that needs proper medical attention. If someone is facing this compulsive stealing disorder then rather than hiding it and living in the fear of getting caught, itâ€™s better to discuss it with family and seek a solution without being defensive.</h5></p>
				<h5>Which of the following are true statements about kleptomaniacs?</h5>
						<p>
						<input type="checkbox">(A) Kleptomaniacs are victims of a habit that overrules their control over their minds.<br>
						<input type="checkbox">(B) Kleptomaniacs often take up this habit to fulfil the vacuum in their past lives.<br>

  						<input type="checkbox">(D) Timely help and counselling may save the person.<br>
