			<h1 align="center">Here’s how it works</h1>
<p>Our QEAC certified Education Counsellors will take the time to learn about your career aspirations, lifestyle, career and migration goals if any so we can offer tailored, personal advice. And because we’re completely independent, you can relax knowing we’ll only suggest the best course and institute options for you.</p>
	<ol>
<li>Step 1 – We listen to you</li><br>

Tell us about your education up to now, your interests and skill sets, as well as your preferred lifestyle location. We can suggest some great options as well as locations, and advise you on courses, career paths and possible financial assistance. Often there are scholarships available for students relocating to a different state.<br><br>
<li>Step 2 – Then we work out the details</li><br>

Once we’ve worked out your personal and professional goals, we’ll go into detail to find the universities and institutes that can offer your courses aligned with your career path and chosen city. We’ll check that you meet the entry requirements and talk about visa requirements at this stage.<br><br>
		
<li>Step 3 – Address any visa or migration issues</li><br>

Our team of MARA Registered Migration agents will make sure you’re covered by an appropriate study or residency visa to continue your studies in Australia, as well as ensure you meet all of the requirements with your new course to stay visa compliant.<br><br>
<li>Step 4 – We’ll handle the application process</li><br>

There’s no need to worry about the paperwork, we’ll take care of everything for you, liaise with the authorities and your educational provider to make sure everything runs smoothly. We can even help with migration services if you choose to take up Permanent Residency in the time to come.All you need to do is ensure that you’ve got appropriate health cover, insurance, sufficient financial resources, and that you meet any English language requirements. We can help you with each of these as well if needed – just ask us in the initial consultation.<br><br>
